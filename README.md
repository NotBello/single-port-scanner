# single-port-scanner
This repo contains the code for a CLI based single port scanner, programmed using python 2.
This tool was developed to better understand the logic behind port scanners.

This application uses python 2 for better scope against locally implementing in misconfigured target machines
And uses socket library to check for any error during connection before putting together an appropriate response reflecting the state of the port.

The console based application has two inputs;
- host(IP or domain)
- port number

This tool can be used during Penetration Testing, Network Analysis and OS strengthening.
